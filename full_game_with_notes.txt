Note Taker (to User):

Let's begin by analyzing the game state, history, and any prior notes taken to understand the opponents' possible cards and strategies.

**Current game state:**
- Kevin (you) have 2 coins and the cards Captain and Contessa.
- Wilma, Keith, and Margarito each have 2 coins and unknown cards.
- Kevin is the current player.
- The deck size is 7 and the treasury has 42 coins.

Since the round history (previous turns) and prior notes are not available, we should focus on their unknown cards and possible strategies based on the general game state and typical player behavior.

Let's make initial notes for each opponent:

1. **Wilma**:
   - **Suspected Cards**: Since Wilma’s cards are unknown, we can only speculate based on typical gameplay.
     - Possible cards: Duke, Assassin, Captain, Ambassador, Contessa (all cards are equally likely at this stage).
   - **Strategy Notes**: With only 2 coins, her immediate actions might involve Income (to gain 1 coin) or claiming a character action like Duke to gain 3 coins, Captain to steal coins, or Ambassador to exchange cards for better influence.

2. **Keith**:
   - **Suspected Cards**: Similar to Wilma, Keith’s cards are unknown.
     - Possible cards: Duke, Assassin, Captain, Ambassador, Contessa (all cards equally likely).
   - **Strategy Notes**: Keith might also try to gain coins or exchange cards. His choice of action will reveal more information about his strategy and possible cards.

3. **Margarito**:
   - **Suspected Cards**: Margarito’s cards are also unknown.
     - Possible cards: Duke, Assassin, Captain, Ambassador, Contessa (all cards equally likely).
   - **Strategy Notes**: Margarito might also perform actions to gain coins or exchange cards to get more favorable influence.

Let's formalize the notes for these players:

### Notes to add:

- **Wilma**:
  - **Suspected Cards**: Duke (Low confidence), Assassin (Low confidence), Captain (Low confidence), Ambassador (Low confidence), Contessa (Low confidence)
  - **Strategy Notes**: Limited strategy information; likely to perform Income or claim character action for coins or exchange.

- Adjust the notes as new information becomes available.

If there's nothing further right now, you can proceed with your turn. If any further note-taking or updates are required based on new events, I'll be here to assist.

Let's begin by analyzing the game state, history, and any prior notes taken to understand the opponents' possible cards and strategies.

**Current game state:**
- Kevin (you) have 2 coins and the cards Captain and Contessa.
- Wilma, Keith, and Margarito each have 2 coins and unknown cards.
- Kevin is the current player.
- The deck size is 7 and the treasury has 42 coins.

Since the round history (previous turns) and prior notes are not available, we should focus on their unknown cards and possible strategies based on the general game state and typical player behavior.

Let's make initial notes for each opponent:

1. **Wilma**:
   - **Suspected Cards**: Since Wilma’s cards are unknown, we can only speculate based on typical gameplay.
     - Possible cards: Duke, Assassin, Captain, Ambassador, Contessa (all cards are equally likely at this stage).

2. **Keith**:
   - **Suspected Cards**: Similar to Wilma, Keith’s cards are unknown.
     - Possible cards: Duke, Assassin, Captain, Ambassador, Contessa (all cards equally likely).
   - **Strategy Notes**: Keith might also try to gain coins or exchange cards. His choice of action will reveal more information about his strategy and possible cards.

3. **Margarito**:

     - Possible cards: Duke, Assassin, Captain, Ambassador, Contessa (all cards equally likely).
   - **Strategy Notes**: Margarito might also perform actions to gain coins or exchange cards to get more favorable influence.
