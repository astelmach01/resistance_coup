Georgia:
	1. Suspected Cards: Duke (Medium confidence): Georgia might be hoarding coins quickly to use Tax later.
	2. Suspected Cards: Captain (Low confidence): Could be preparing to steal if Roger or Melinda gain more coins.
	3. Strategy Notes: Possibly building up to a high-income strategy, might challenge Foreign Aid to protect potential Duke influence.
	4. Suspected Cards: Unknown (No information on Georgia's cards so far).
	5. Strategy Notes: Georgia has no coins currently, which limits her options to Income (1 coin) or taking a risk to claim a character action. She might aim to gather coins to prepare for future influence or potential coups.
Melinda:
	1. Suspected Cards: Assassin (Low confidence): Holding 2 coins could be prepping for an Assassination if coins increase.
	2. Suspected Cards: Contessa (Low confidence): Could potentially block an Assassination if spotted.
	3. Strategy Notes: Low on coins but might be playing conservatively, watches for opponents' Assassinations or high-coin collections.
Roger:
	1. Suspected Cards: Ambassador (Medium confidence): Might block Stealing or use Exchange for better cards.
	2. Suspected Cards: Captain (Low confidence): Could be waiting to steal coins from anyone gathering more.
	3. Strategy Notes: Likely defensive, might watch for optimal stealing opportunities or card exchanges.
